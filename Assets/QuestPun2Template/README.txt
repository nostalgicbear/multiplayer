Hello! Thanks for purchasing :)

For using this package, you need to:

1. Set project to export for Oculus quest
2. Import Oculus Integration
3. Import Photon Pun2 free version https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922
4. Import Photon Voice 2 free https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/photon-voice-2-130518
5. Go to https://www.photonengine.com/ and create an account, and create a new PUN app and you will get an appID. Copy it and paste it in the PhotonServerSettings config file in the project in App id Realtime and App id Voice fields.
6. Add the 2 scenes to your build settings "Photon2Lobby" and "Photon2Room" in that order.
7. Enjoy :)

PD: you can switch "tools" ingame with thumbstick press.
